## Humans, verified by Humans

VouchMe.id is a social verification platform where trust is built through human connection. We're reimagining online identity verification through a decentralized approach that puts the power of trust back in human hands.

## Our Vision

In a digital world filled with anonymous accounts, bots, and deepfakes, establishing authentic human presence has become increasingly challenging. VouchMe.id provides a solution by creating a web of trust through social vouching combined with optional document verification.

We believe that:

- **Trust is social**: The most reliable form of verification comes from actual humans who know you
- **Verification should be accessible**: No complex KYC processes required for basic trust establishment
- **Identity is multi-layered**: Different contexts require different levels of verification
- **Community standards matter**: Communities self-regulate who belongs through mutual vouching

## How VouchMe.id Works

### Bronze Verification: The Social Trust Network

To become Bronze verified, you need endorsements from three existing verified users. This creates a chain of trust that spreads organically through real human connections.

1. Create an account with your phone number
2. Share your personal verification link with people who know you
3. Once three verified users vouch for you, you receive your Bronze verification badge
4. Your verification stays active as long as you maintain those endorsements

### Silver Verification: Additional Trust Layer

For contexts requiring higher assurance, users can upgrade to Silver verification by adding document verification powered by Claude AI, while maintaining the human element of Bronze verification.

## Key Features

## Our Difference

Unlike traditional verification systems that rely solely on government IDs or biometrics, VouchMe.id builds on the age-old concept of social vouching, where trust is established through relationships and community accountability.

- **Privacy-focused**: Minimal data collection for basic verification
- **User control**: You decide what information to share and with whom
- **Decentralized trust**: No single authority determines your verification status
- **Progressive system**: Choose the verification level that matches your needs

## Technology

VouchMe.id is built on a modern technology stack:

- **Backend**: Go with Gin framework
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage
- **iOS App**: SwiftUI
